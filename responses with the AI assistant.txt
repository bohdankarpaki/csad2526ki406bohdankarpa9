me: Create program "Hello World" on C++
AI:
Of course! Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++.

C++

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
## How It Works
#include <iostream>: This line includes the input/output stream library, which lets you use std::cout to print text to the console.

int main(): This is the main function where your program's execution begins. Every C++ program must have a main() function.

std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;:

std::cout is the standard output stream object (stands for character output).

The << operator is used to send the string "Hello, World!" to std::cout.

std::endl inserts a new line and tells the console that the line is finished.

return 0;: This line signals that the program has finished successfully. A return value of 0 means no errors occurred.

## How to Compile and Run
Save the code in a file named hello.cpp (or any other name with a .cpp extension).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Compile the code using a C++ compiler like g++.

Bash

g++ hello.cpp -o hello
Run the compiled program.

Bash

./hello
You should see the following output in your terminal:
Hello, World!
